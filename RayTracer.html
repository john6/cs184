        Basic Requirments - NOTE: I have listed some of the commands needed to recreate each picture but when running our code they were stored in files<br>
        <br>
        The First Hurdle- Creating the Red Sphere, We call this "OMMYGODITSWORKING"<br>
        <img src="image01.png"WIDTH = 300 HEIGHT = 300> <br><br>

        sphere 0 0 -5 2 1 0 0
        point 0 0 200 .6 .6 .6<br>
        The classic red sphere, rendered with one point light and only an ambient color of Red. <br>
        Time: about 5 seconds<br><br> 


            Next was adding lighting and shading. This one is "Longing for the days of Project 1"<br>
            <img src="Image02.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500> <br><br>
                size 640 640

                diffuse 1 0 1<br> 
                A shaded blue sphere similar to what we did in Project 1. One point light, one directional light, diffuse and specular componenets. <br>
                Time: about 10 seconds<br><br>

        Now it was time to get some multiple spheres and colors going. <br>
        <img src="Image03.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500> <br><br>
        #green sphere 0 -1 -5 .2 .1 .5 .1

        diffuse 1 0 1  
        specular 1 1 1 
        shininess 16<br>
        A few shaded spheres in different colors. Point and directional light, specular and diffuse terms added.<br>
        Time: about 30 seconds<br><br><br>

        Next was getting some triangles. Title: "Minimalism with polygons" and "Tiles and Errors, a pun"<br>
        <img src="Image04.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500> 
        <img src="Image05.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500><br>

        Then came Transformations. TITLE: "Circle and Elipse"<br>
        <img src="Image06.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500>

        One has been transoformed about the Y axis, and the other has not<br>
        Time: about 30 seconds<br><br><br>

        Now for some Shadowing. Title: "Shady Ladies"<br>  
        <img src="BlueShadow.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500> 
        <img src="Image08.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500>

A prime example of shadowing. The two spheres are the same colors but one is clearly being shadowed by the other from the Point light located on the same z axis as the spheres. Specular light is also on. <br>
Time: about 30 seconds<br>
The other two we had saved as images but not their input files. Still wanted to put them up though!<br><br><br> 


        The final step was Recursive Reflections. TITLE: "The Recursive Rainbow" <br>
         <img src="Image09.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500> <br><br>
         size 1000 1000

         The first reflective image. Rendered with a max depth of 5 and a point light centered directly towards the origin the four spheres are clearly reflecting each other. Specular componenet also on for all spheres. <br>
         Time: about 1 minute<br><br><br> 

         Now putting it all together.<br>
        <img src="Image10.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500>
         <img src="Image11.png"WIDTH = 500 HEIGHT = 500>

two of the balls are shadowing the third
there is one directional light and one point light
there is no reflection<br>

My favorite image. 6 spheres and 6 triangles. Reflecting off each other in beautiful harmony. One point light used, a max recursive depth of 5 and specular terms on for all objects. <br>

Our final image, it has it all shading reflection shadows. The four corner spheres are the same color and the three center spheres are also the same but becasue of the shadows and reflections they appear much different. On point light directed towards the origin and on coming from the right side of the image. Each spere also has a specular term. Max recursive depth was 5. <br>
