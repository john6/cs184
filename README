Notes:

Out code outputs .ppm images but I have converted them to .png for the webpage. I am submitting the .png files. Our images are rendered on the command line by compiling then running ./Main “filename”. All of our scenes we’re written ourselves. I have included the files that described each corresponding named image. Transformations we implement in our main file and do not get inputed by the input file.
